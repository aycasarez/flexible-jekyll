Hello!

This is a short post to start off my learning blog for my residency program. The blog only took me a few ~~days~~ minutes to set up and I really just wanted to test this out.

Later today I will write/reflect on some of the experiences I've had during my first month, including tiptoeing around institutional politics, getting back into learning technology skills with communities of practice and transitioning from a grad student into a "professional" position. 

Yay!
